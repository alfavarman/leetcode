TASK 2
One famous monotonic stack interview question is the sunset view problem. In this problem, you’re given an array of buildings, where each building is represented by its height. The buildings are in line with each other, meaning that if one building is taller than the other, they will be blocked from seeing the sunset. The sun sets to the right side. Your goal is to find all the buildings that can see the sunset.

Here’s an example array of buildings and their heights:

let buildings = [18, 14, 13, 16, 12];
